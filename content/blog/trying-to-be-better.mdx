# trying to do better
hey guys👋 u might know me from X(twiiter) as <Link  href={"https://x.com/subhraneeltwt"} className="text-muted-foreground" alt={"my-twitter"}>
@subhraneeltwt</Link> 

most prolly im a stranger to you so, hello im a 21y/o engineer who loves building, breaking and learning things. currently in my final year and tbh i was 
totally delusional in my 2nd year and completely unaware of the fact that this job market is totally fucked up. but i will still fight till end.

## the only regret
not starting earlier. as now i've seriously started to give my time and energy in building projects and learning the hard stuffs. 
i've realised i should've started from second year itself. although i dont get sad about it, cause right now im doing what i must do and that is 
constant improvement towards my skills.

honestly sometimes i do get angry on myself for having too much hope in the past. still thats the part of the journey and we all must learn something
from those even if they are not perfect/good.

## realising only development is not enough
yes yes ik ik, we all hate dsa. cuz why shouldn't we, everytime we see, there is a new "course" or a "roadmap" launched.
even instagram is filled with roadmaps and "comment for resource" type of shits. so its obvious to say that dsa is highly milked and oversaturated by
mainly indian coding community.

but seeing from a different perspective, dsa is a very imp skill to have, mainly in this vibecoding era.

<Callout>why? because vibecoding has eaten up our problem solving skills</Callout> but if you see dsa's main idea is to build the problem-solving skill in you,
although i highly doubt that now because most of the devs just want to see the "numbers of questions" they solved on leetcode, so they 
copy-pasta solutions from chatgpt. 
yes im not kidding i've seen people do ts. 
also few can't even start solving a question on their own until they watch the video lecture of it.
i mean that just kills your problem solving skills isn't it.

## what can we improve
its simple but not easy. maybe im wrong but this is what i've figured out:
- watch or get the concept of the topic, lets say sorting
- after u get the basics of it, dont wait for the perfect moment to start solving questions
- just open leetcode, search for sorting problems and start with easy or medium ones
- this one thing have changed a lot in me in terms of problem solving

## what i follow
- understanding the algorithm from yt video (keep in mind i said algorithm not the question)
- opening the question (easy/medium, doesnt matters)
- don't start coding now!
- then i open excalidraw and start visualising the question and what its trying to say
- like this

    <Image
    src={"/images/dsa-excalidraw.png"}
    alt="visualisations"
    width={1280}
    height={720}
    />

- then coming up with the worst approach or the one that comes in my mind at that moment
- dry running all the examples given by leetcode
- now here i open cursor and start writing the code, and then after runnign with all the examples from leetcode after everything passes
- now paste that wriiten sol. in leetcode with, now most of the time when u click 'submit' it will fail
- fixing and coming up again with a good solutions

this alone takes upto 1 to 1.5hrs, also im just a beginner in dsa and learning it. 
this was my thought process and understanding of dsa of how it should be done. i can be 100% wrong and would love to be critised and get some feedback.

## am i proud of myself ?
yes im, ik it sounds cringe but the truth is in Nov 2025 i promised myself i would finish my sideproject.
it might sound like no big deal, but it was for me because previously i started building projects even good ones but never finished them or even if i did.
after few days i tend to forget about it and move to a new one. so i decided to change and thats why i feel good that i finsihed building my sideproject.

the sideproject im talking about is <Link href={"https://subhraneel.vercel.app"} className="text-muted-foreground" alt={"study-toolkit"}>
study-toolkit</Link> (self promotion, haha)

<Callout>i learned about react server components, server actions, writing clean and readable code, working with ai-sdk, sending emails and what not
from building this single project. no other tutorial could've taught me this.</Callout>
now its live and fully opensource with 10+ issues opened. many good folks gave feedbacks on which i worked on as well, (felt super good)

like, one friend from twitter suggested me to add credit-based system instead of asking user to put their api key, which was actually good and so i built that 
feature in 3 days, and now my sideproject has credit based system.

and currently im building a cool project that can generate yt shorts/reels style ai videos with one prompt
(its in development r9, i post about its progress freqently on X(twitter), also its opensource) 

## repos im working on
so for the curious folks, these are the github repositories in which im currently working on

## more stuff im slowly starting
- learning about python, because in future im looking forward to build ai related projects 
- also learning about huggingface's community
- reading one research paper that actually excites me
<Link href={"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04356"} className="text-muted-foreground" alt={"research-paper"}>
(currently reading this one. its about openai's tts whisper model)
</Link>

## thats it friends
if you are still here, thanks a lot for reading to my yapping. ill return in Avengers: Doomsday, bye👋.
