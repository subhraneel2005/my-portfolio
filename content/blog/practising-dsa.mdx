# learning and practicing

for the past few days, i’ve been learning binary search, solved some practice problems and completed 6 leetcode questions so far.

before getting into details, a few important things to mention:

- i’m learning from kunal kushwaha’s java dsa playlist:  
  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ
- i’m pushing all my practice code to this repository:  
  https://github.com/subhraneel2005/dsa

## what i’ve learned so far

until now, i’ve covered the following concepts related to binary search:

- simple binary search on a sorted array
- binary search on an order-agnostic array (where we don’t know if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order)
- finding the ceiling and floor of a target element
- mountain arrays
- finding the peak element in a mountain array
- finding a target element in a mountain array

## why i’m learning binary search

for me, binary search feels like the real starting point of data structures and algorithms. it’s not just about reducing time complexity to `o(log n)`, but about learning how to think in terms of conditions, boundaries, and invariants.

if i can understand binary search deeply and clearly, i believe it will make my overall dsa foundation much stronger.

## how i approach problems

i don’t jump straight into coding when i see a question. instead, i follow a very simple process:

- i take a notebook and a pen and write down the problem very rougly
- i sketch or write out test cases
- i note down the core idea, logic and the conditions
- i dry run the algorithm on 1–2 relevant examples

only when the concept and flow are completely clear in my mind then i start writing code.

## things i consciously do for every question

some simple rules i try to follow consistently:

- clear the concept on paper before touching the keyboard
- explicitly write down the conditions, especially:
  - loop end condition
  - if-else branches
- being very clear about what the function should return
- dry running on atleast one example properly

this slows me down initially, but it saves a lot of confusion and bugs later.

## key elements in binary search problems

most binary search questions revolve around a few core variables:

- start
- end
- mid
- target (not always required, but often involved)

in most cases, the loop condition ends up being either:

- `start <= end`
- `start < end`

understanding _why_ one works better than the other in a given problem is something i’m actively focusing on.

## problems i’ve solved so far

here are the leetcode submissions i’ve completed till now:

- https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1858928841/
- https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1860043450/
- https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1866408812/
- https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1866439161/
- https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1866601560/
- https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1866605930/

so far binary search has already taught me a lot about structured thinking and problem breakdown. planning to keep going, stay consistent, and build this foundation properly. also a huge thanks to kunal's playlist he is such an amazing teacher.
